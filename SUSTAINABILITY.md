# Unity Project Sustainability

Since release in 2008, until it was abandoned in 2013, Unity became defacto IoC standard. Projects, large and small, used Unity to implement systems ranging from simple UI apps (Prism library encouraged it) to multi-billion dollar trading systems.

By the nature of the technology, dependency injection container is always at the core of each system and provides critical functionality for the entire implementation. If it fails, entire system fails.
Obviously Unity Container is not a hobby project, a lot of businesses heavily depend on it for day to day operation. The stability and quality of the code is paramount.

## Project is not sustainable

Unfortunately, ever since it was released into Open Source domain, it was supported by just a handful of people at their leisure time. Being complicated, but free software presented the following challenges:

- No one wants to pay for free software

- Implementing any DI container is not a trivial task, the learning curve is steep. Finding people interested in learning internals and contributing to the project without being paid is next to impossible

- With accelerated frequency of .NET releases work being done on the library [rapidly deprecated](https://github.com/unitycontainer/container/issues/312) by new releases

Existing support scheme is no longer sustainable. To continue support and development of Unity the user community must help.

## Sustainability by Community Support

In order for the project to survive and continue development, Unity must by financially sustainable. Please provide your opinion on the subject in this [discussion](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/discussions/368).

Meanwhile, until better solution is found, everyone who uses Unity commercially, must contribute. A contribution may by:

- contributing [code](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or [bug fixes](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- documentation
- contributing financially
